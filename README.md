# Proverif-pi-vim
[Proverif](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/) Pi calculus vim syntax highlighting. Use file extension `.prov`.
It might not be complete, since I have not used the program that much and only included the things that I have used so far.

## Installation
### Using vim-plug
Add the following line to your vimrc.
```
Plug 'ruudjelinssen/proverif-pi-vim'
```

### Other plugin managers
I haven't tested them yet. Should work too.
